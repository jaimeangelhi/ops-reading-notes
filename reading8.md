To write an ISO file to a CD, DVD, or removeable media/USB the removable media must be able to assemble the files of the ISO file prior to burning/writing them.  Various Windows OS can burn ISO without additional software, but certain other software could be needed to format and flash the ISO onto the removable media in an assembled way.
