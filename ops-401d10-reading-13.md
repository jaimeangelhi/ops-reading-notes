1. What are the benefits of a forward proxy?

The benefits of a proxy, or a forward proxy, are that the server can act as a middleman between the client and the webserver, allowing client computers to either circumnavigate the restrictions placed on their searches (by the government censoring in certain countries), or narrow the browsing/networking capabilities of the client computers (as in a public library or a classroom environment keeping the computers within certain boundaries).  This allows for better security in certain situations.

2. Explain the differences between a forward and a reverse proxy?

A forward proxy is in front of the client computers, whereas the reverse proxy is situated in front of the web servers/endpoints of the developer.  

3. Explain to your manager why your organization might benefit from implementing a reverse proxy?

The reverse proxy will allow a layer of protection for the organization, allowing for web load balancing for the different servers, possible protection from DDOS attacks as the middleman of the reverse proxy stands in the gap and keeps IPs from public access, and much more.
