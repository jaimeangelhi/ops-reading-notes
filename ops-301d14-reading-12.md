1. Explain the role of a Domain Controller?

Domain controller is where user accounts and passwords are managed enabling authentication, it is where group policy settings are stored and able to be adjusted, 

2. What is the benefit of being able to login with the same username and password on any computer joined to the domain? What are the security risks?

It is helpful for flexibility sake (i.e. just going to the first open computer in the lab room, but at the same time, the users' settings and information could potentially get logged or cached into that specific system.

3. Describe how group policies are used in domains?

Group policies can be administered in the domain controller and system and network administrators would be able to apply changes to the group policies in that domain controller as well.  If it's in the domain controller settings, then the computer abides by those.

4.In what other ways can you think of that domains could be used beyond what was presented in the reading?

Domains can also be used beyond what was presented in the reading by applying apps and updates, improving security settings, forwarding important messages/reminders, custom email addressing, and more.
