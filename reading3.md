Main reason we're learning this is to understand the importance of the startup process, how that functions and ways to troubleshoot and/or adjust settings.

1. What is the BIOS?

It is initializing sequence called the Basic Input Output System, it loads the OS after the computer is powered up as per the reading in (https://www.learncomputerscienceonline.com/bios/)

2. Use analogies from your previous background to explain what happens during the booting process?

During the booting process, the CPU contacts the BIOS which in turn kicks the starting sequences of keyboard/monitor, troubleshooting checks, boot sequence, and then it loads up and starts up the OS.

3. What is the “Power On Self Test”?

The BIOS runs the POST in the initial startup sequences, it basically teats the different hardware to ensure the computer will operate correctly upon startup.

4. What is the CMOS?

The CMOS is the complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (a small portion of memory on the motherboard) that contains the BIOS.

5. What is the CMOS battery?

The CMOS battery is the small round battery on the motherboard that powers the ram for the BIOS.
