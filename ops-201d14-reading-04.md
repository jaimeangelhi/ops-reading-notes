# Reading 4

1. What should you do if multiple issues are happening simultaneously during troubleshooting?

Ensure multiple tickets are submitted for each issue, and resolve to care for each individually and collectively.

2. What should be done once a successful solution has been identified during the troubleshooting process?

Once a successful solution is identified during the troubleshooting process, then ensure the proper steps for resolution of the issues are accomplished and documented.

3. What are the benefits of documenting the entire troubleshooting process in a knowledge base?

Documenting the entire process in a knowledge base allows future help desk technicians or even users to more easily find solutions/processes to resolve their issue, as opposed to trying to start from scratch the next time. 

4. Think about a technological device particularly popular in your culture or community. Imagine a scenario where issues arise: how would you apply CompTIA A+ troubleshooting methodology to help, while considering the end-userâ€™s cultural background?

As far ad cultural background, I would moreso consider the user's application of the technical device or understanding of the associated technology. I would then apply CompTIA A+ troubleshooting to their situation by applying the most efficient steps to resolve the problem, while also attributing for the user's insight and learning.

## Things I want to know more about

Good knowledge bases for future troubleshooting resolution.
