1. What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?

Three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams are trust, effective and open communication, and good leadership that supports and encourages the team.

2. Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.

A former professional setting that I was in did not have much psychological safety, it did not allow for much trust as the company leadership maintained a tight hold on information and had little to no transparency with the behind the scenes operations that affected our day to day processes.  It affected trust and communication (which should be a two way road as opposd to a peanut gallery), and truly wasn't a psychological safe environment.

3. What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?

The impact of teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety on their company and other team members can change a culture.  That team would allow others to envision an effective way to establish safe working environments, and encourage and foster better growth and team development.  It could also encourage individuals to flourish on their own and within the group context.
