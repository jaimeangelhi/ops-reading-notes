1. How has virtualization evolved beyond desktops and servers?

Virtualization has evolved beyond desktops and servers to span network, storage, data devices, as well as applications through app virtualization. (https://www.joe0.com/2017/06/11/importance-of-virtualization-in-the-amazon-ec2-cloud/)

2. In the context of the Amazon IaaS Cloud Service Model, what does EC2 stand for?

EC2 stands for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, an IaaS service that provides virtual servers based on the Xen hypervisor.

3. What types of storage does EC2 use, and how is EC2 web traffic managed?

The types of storage EC2 uses include Ephemeral (temporary) or Elastic Block Storage snapshots stored in Amazon S3.

4. What are the benefits of service-oriented architecture for customers of EC2 virtualized services?

The benefits of service-oriented architecture for customers of EC2 virtualized services include "the ability to control virtualization through a web interface, as well as to manage the entire system through API".

5. Analyze how cloud virtualization can promote equitable access to technology resources across diverse populations. How can this technology bridge cultural gaps and empower underserved communities?

Cloud virtualization can promote equitable access to technology resources across diverse populations in that the hardware and other physical, financially inaccessible resources are now at hand (literally the palm of our hands).  Just having a tablet or even mobile device allows people in even third world countries the ability to connect to such resources through cloud virtualization, and has the potential to promote diversity across the web and the globe.  Unfortunately, those resources are still only as accessible as an owner/creater/author makes them to be (subscriptions, network services, etc), and until the capitalist issue is resolved, there may still stand cultural gaps to bridge and underserved communities to be empowered.
