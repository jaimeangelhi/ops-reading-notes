1. From your day to day computer use, provide examples of when data is at rest and when it is in transit.

Data at rest is data that is in a file or folder on my computer, not going anywhere or doing anything like a song or document just on my pc.  Data in transit would be uploading something to a cloud drive, sending an email, connecting to a website, and other things that would entail data traversing some kind of network.

2. Explain the role data encryption with regards to the CIA triad.

Data encryption's role in the CIA triad is very much tied to the confidentiality piece, as encrypting data ensures that the information is kept from those who should not have access to it.  It is also important for the integrity portion as well though, because encrypting data can keep the information "safe" from being tampered with as it is encrypted and will not be easily accessible to those that do not have the proper authorities or keys to view/decrypt.  It is also important to the availability of the CIA triad, in that encryption should also entail decryption, and that should mean the data is available once decrypted for whatever purpose it was to serve.
