# Reading 14 Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging

Consider the history: That Time When Women Stopped Coding

1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

Personal computers came on to the scene and were marketed to males as opposed to females.  Males got computers as a result and from young ages were able to become familiar with computers, whereas women did not have as many opportunities to become computer savvy.  Colleges then expected those in computer science majors to have previous experience with computers as opposed to the teaching in the 70s that didn't have that expectation and then taught everyone at the same level.  Women had less opportunities, and even if they did get the opportunity, they were then discouraged or gaslighted because of their lack of perceived ability.

2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

They were then more familiar with computing processes and the system functions, whereas the females may not have had that experience and then were perceived to be ignorant or holding back the other students in the class.

3. Review the data: Employee breakdown of key technology companies

Ask the question: Why diversity matters to your tech company

1. When are diversity efforts most successful?

As they're driven by company leaders that are truly committed to diversity.

2. Why do diverse companies perform better?

They have teams of people that can see various perspectives and bring new ideas and dynamics to the table for a further reach and better customer satisfaction.

3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

A diverse company can serve a diverse user base and vise-versa by giving a voice and a choice to those that aren't usually heard or seen.  A diverse company sees more than just one specific way and will allow for multiple methods or differing services/products to help accomodate those needs and customers that may not have been catered to.
