# Reading 2 

Learning how to build a computer, along with the earlier lesson of what is a computer, is very relevant to anyone in this day and age of computers and technology.  Especially getting this information in as a cybersecurity professional makes a difference in awareness and being able to maneuver and manipulate various issues related to the computer.


1. Which is better in a CPU, more cores or higher speed? Under which circumstances is that true? How many CPU cores does a computer need?

As per the Reading 2 assignment from WikiHow, "The higher the processor's speed in gigahertz (GHz), the faster it can process data. Many applications use multiple threads at the same time, so more cores can improve performance." So it would depend on the usage for the computer and the necessary functioning.  Around 6 core would be sufficient.

2. What details are you looking for when finding a motherboard which fits your processor?

You'd want to ensure the motherboard is compatible with the cpu via the socket, and aligns with the other needs of the computer as far as wifi, RAM slots, graphics card ports, etc.

3. What are the tradeoffs you’d evaluate while selecting a storage device?

Price versus speed.  The higher speed SSD and M.2 cost more, but the slower and more fragile HDD is more cost effective but contains moving parts susceptible to damage.

4. Think about others with a background similar to yours. How would you explain to them the key parts of a computer, in a way they’d best connect with?

I would inform them of the many factors that would be necessary to actually build up your own computer, including cost, speeds, functionality, and overall user needs.  I'd probably try to break it down barney-style, but let them have a link to the WikiHow article (https://www.wikihow.com/Build-a-Computer)
