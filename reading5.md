Learning the Linux command line and installing a virtual box with Linux terminal is important to adjust and manipulate various features in the computer 

1. Explain the terms “shell”, “terminal”, “cli”, and “command prompt”. Why are these still used today, when we have graphical interfaces?

Shell, terminal, cli, and command prompt are all basically synonyms for bringing up the same command line terminal.  These are still used today in different OS, and are relevant because of the need to code, create, program, and adjust.  It is also important to still have these terminals in the event that a mouse is unavailable or while remoting in to a vm.

2. What are the commands to change directories, list the file’s contents and rename/move files?

The command to change directories is "cd", to list the files contents is "ls", and to rename/move files is "mv".

3. What are relative and absolute paths? What is special about starting with a ~ (tilde) or a ‘/’ character in the path?

Relative paths are relative to the location you are to the location you came from or are heading to "relative paths. That is, the place you end up at depends on your current working directory", whereas the absolute path is the straight shot back to the root.  Starting with a ~  or / in the path means absolute path, the / is a root/parent/home directory.

4. Explain what Linux is, using anything except English.

cmd, / ~ pwd cd mv file.txt
