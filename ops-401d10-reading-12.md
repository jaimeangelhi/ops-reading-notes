1. What are three tasks which SOCs often perform?

Three tasks which Security Operations Center (SOC) will often perform include building and maintaining the security architecture; monitoring/detecting/analyzing/responding to cybersecurity threats and incidents; overseeing all activity on servers/databases/networks/apps/endpoint devices/websites.  This would thwart incidents as fast as possible, assess vulnerabilities and penetrations, dealing with those problems in real time and also finding ways to make the security posture improved.

2. Explain what a SIEM solution is and how the SOC utilizes it in non-technical terms.

A SIEM solution is a security information and event management solution.  It basically collects network data from the organization and then organizes it from the different various sources, giving the SOC a leg up to effective monitor and respond to any anomolies in the network infrastructure much faster and efficiently.  SIEM solutions help the SOC to be better aware and responsive for the betterment of the network, combating any threats with the data that has been sifted through and organized and filtered by the SIEM.

3. How does the typical SOC team structure resemble the structure of an IT Help Desk.

The typical SOC team structure resembles the structure of an IT help desk in that it takes problems that are addressed and then divides those problems between different roles and areas of the team.  Some will receive the problems/concerns, deal with and resolve those issues, others will address the follow up and policies (adding to the rolladex of solutions to said issues), and still others will handle the customer facing nature of the issues/concerns for the consumers/organization.
