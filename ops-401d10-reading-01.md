1. How would you convince your future company to pursue SOC2 compliance?

I would let them know that this is the base minimum we need to ensure we are compliant and protecting our customers' data in the cloud, to ensure security, integrity, and availability needed. It also helps to not only give the customers piece of mind, but also allows the company to adhere to standards of security that will ensure better CYA and coverage for data protection down the line.  It shows the customer and other enterprises that we are serious about data protection, and that will also help to expand the scope of clientele we work with down the line (as well as aids in any further security questionnaires we will encounter when working with enterprise-scale customers).
   
2. What are the five SOC2 Trust Principles?

The five SOC2 Trust Principles are security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and data privacy.
   
3. How would your explain the three levels of the SOC2 pyramid in an analogy your friends or former colleagues would understand?

The three levels of the SOC2 pyramid are the foundational base level of Security Policies that we do, followed on with the execution level of how we do the Security Procedures, then finally, topped with the Proof top of supporting documentation of the proof that we did it.

## Things I want to know more about

Is there a new SOC that may be on the horizon to ensure even greater data protection and compliance (especially as so many companies have compromised customer data with their breached policies or lack of policies thereof).
