1. List 2 differences between firewalls and an IDS?

Two differences between firewalls and an IDS or Intrusion Detection Systems include the firewall being there to keep out malicious attacks whereas the IDS is there to detect and report suspicious or nefarious activity. The IDS is more monitoring and responding and the firewall is more set and forget.

2. Under what circumstances would you choose a network-based IDS over a host-based IDS?

I would choose a network-based IDS over a host-based IDS in the event that I need something quick to implement and lower cost, with a quicker response rate.

3. Name 3 major drawbacks of a NIDS?

Three major drawbacks of a NIDS are that they can't prevent incident by themselves, they require an expert/experienced engineer to be utilized effectively, and false positives are frequent (as well as they don't process encrypted packets and IP packets can still be faked).
