1. Name the three main components which make up PKI.

The three main components that make up PKI include certificate authority, digital certificates, and registration authority.


2. How would you explain, to a non-technical friend, the role PKI plays in protecting traffic between your browser and a web server.

PKI's protect traffic between your browser and a web server in the same way that a lock box on a briefcase kind of works for classified material.  The data goes into the briefcase and gets locked with a specific code or key.  The briefcase is then delivered perhaps with a verbal message or a cover letter to the intended recipient, who will then be able to receive the briefcase and can only open it if they know or have access to the code/key for the briefcase.


3. What is the main weakness of the PKI architecture?

The main weakness of the PKI architecture is that there is too much dependence on the certificate authorities, which can be exploited or compromised.
