1. How can you list the files in the current directory using the command prompt?

You can list the files in the cutrent folder through the command "ls".

2. How might the “sfc” command and the “gpupdate” command help in troubleshooting on Windows?

The "sfc" command helps to scan and repair files whereas the "gpupdate" forces an immediate group policy update.  These cam help in troubleshooting to aid in issues and continuous improvement. 

3. What advantages does the “robocopy” command offer over the “xcopy” command, and why is it useful for file transfers in certain situations?

"Robocopy" command allows the user to copy all subfolders, even if they're empty.  The "xcopy" will copy over files without the read-only attribute, but the "robocopy" will include all attributes like security, owner, timestamps, and auditing info.  This would allow for better file tracking and management.

4. Think about any real-life scenarios from your cultural context where the use of command line tools could be beneficial. Describe one such scenario and explain how a specific command line tool would help address the situation.

Thinking of real-life scenarios in my life, the command line can help to resolve issues in a much more surgical way as opposed to navigating through the sea of generic, basic user options that Mac or Windows offers its system user through GUI prompts.  I think of the requirement to perforn disk management yesterday and how difficult it was to search out the function option, as opposed to just running in the command line.
