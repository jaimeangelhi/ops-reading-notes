1. What is the primary function of a shell in a computerâ€™s operating system?

The primary function of a shell in a computer's operating system is to allow the user to interact with the computer, an application of sorts for running applications.

2. How does Bash locate and execute commands on a Linux or Unix system?

Bash locates and executes commands on a Linux and Unix system by first searching thru different directories on the system to see if the command exists (through the input command prompts), if it does locate the command, it will then execute it.

3. How can you determine if your system is running a Bash shell?

"To find out whether you're running a Bash shell, you can use the echo command along with a special variable representing the name of the currently running process:

$ echo $0
bash"

4. What makes Bash scripting powerful and why is it considered scriptable?

Bash scripting is powerful because it can lead to increased time and productivity through allowing a more automated computing process (by preemptively scripting the commands in a separate text file as opposed to entering them one by one).

5. Bash scripting allows for customization, automation, and efficiency. Discuss methods or practices from your previous work experience or cultural background that aim to achieve similar goals in daily tasks.

Similar to Bash scripting, I previously used customized templates and forms to preemptively fill out multiple forms for various customers.  By inputting information into one specific field, a process was in place to the. divvy that basic information out 
out to the other complementary fields of different forms, really speeding up the process.
