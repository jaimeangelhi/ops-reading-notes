1. What are the main differences between anti-virus and anti-malware software?

The main differences between anti-virus and anti-malware software are that the anti-virus software may not be as up to date as the malware software and it may just focus solely on viruses as opposed to the anti-malware software that covers a wider range of threats beyond just viruses.

2. What are some signs or symptoms that may indicate a malware infection on your PC?

Slow processing times, pop-ups, and other issues.

3. Explain the difference between a full system scan and a quick scan when using antimalware software.

A full system scan will take longer, whereas a quick scan will be accomplished in about 15 or so minutes.  The quick scan could also be referred to as a threat scan, and will just look for items that would fit the bill for threats to the system.  A custom or full scan would be longer and more aggressively search through files for the threat.

4. What should you do if your computer is infected with ransomware?

If your computer is infected with ransomware, you should isolate the infected system, id the ransomware, not pay the ransom, report the incident, restore from backup, use antivirus and antimalware tools, check for decrytion tools, seek professional help, update and patch systems, and educate and train yourself and other users about the ransomware experience.

5. Compare and contrast malware removal techniques in Windows PCs with those in other operating systems like macOS or Linux. How might these different approaches reflect the cultural values and priorities of the technology users?

Different approaches by different OS can be due to the varieties of security models and ways that the systems are set up.  Windows uses antivirus software with signature based scanning and things like Windows Defender for realtime protection.  It also offers safe mode bootup and system restore points allowing for data recovery and malware isolation. MacOS uses gateekeper that only installs approved and identified developers through and into the mac systems, it also has built in protection known as XProtect, and Apple reviews all apps prior to allowing them to enter the app store.  Basically, these reflect cultural values and priorities of the technology users in that Windows allows the user to be more or less in control of their own protection offering basic protection levels.  Mac culturally has a tighter grip on the safety of their users and maintains a good safeguard on their proprietary information and product quality and protection.  Windows lets the user drive, whereas Mac will put the bumpers and helmets on before the user takes a ride.
