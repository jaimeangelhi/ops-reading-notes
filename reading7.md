Understanding how to remotely access a lab computer is very helpful for a future in IT or cybersecurity, especially as this would allow a much greater amount of work to be done in a more efficient and timelier way.

1. What is the Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol?

SSH Protocol is a secure remote login from one computer into another.  It allows one computer to access and manipulate files and folders/programs from another computer.

2. What are the typical uses of the SSH protocol?

Typical uses of the SSH protocol include a secure access and connection, file transfers that are interactive and automated, ability to perform remote commands, and "managing network infrastructure and other mission-critical system components." (ssh.com/academy/ssh/protocol)

3. How does the SSH protocol work?

The client will initiate and connect with the server, the server will send a public key to server, both sides will negotiate and open secure channel, and then the client will input the user login to server host operating system.  Basically, one computer will log-in to the "remote" computer securely and be able to manipulate the remote computer with a secure shell access.

4. How is the data kept safe when transmitted between the SSH client and server?

There is strong authentication between the two computers with the public key authentication, SSH keys, and encryption algorithms that have been agreed upon between the host and server.

5. What is SFTP?

Secure file transfer protocol

What is RDP? And how to use it

7. What is Windows Remote Desktop Connection?

Windows remote desktop connection is a tool that allows a user to connect remotely to another computer running windows over the local network.  The user would then be able to remotely access the entire computer system and functions on their own computer, as if they were manipulating the remote computer itself.

8. What is RDP?

Remote Desktop Protocol

9. What is the RDP port number?

3389
