# Jaimes Ops Reading Notes

## Ops Readings

### Reading #1

The reading assignment was very eye-opening to see the importance of supply chain management especially as it pertains to computer hardware components.  Computers and processors/servers are integrated into every part of life, and if they are compromised, daily life and everyday functions can be disrupted and devastated.

1. How is a hardware hack different than a software hack?

Hardware hacks leave a "physical" bread crumb trail through the various components that have been affected amidst the supply chain.
   
2. What are the two ways for spies to alter a computerâ€™s hardware?

Interdiction - manipulating devices while in transit from manufacturer to customer
Seeding attack - changing components of devices during beginning manufacture

3. Explain how the hack worked.

The various spies infiltrated the manufacturing plants and either bribed or coerced the factory management/workers to comply with the addition of various chip components to the supermicro servers being manufactured in China/Taiwan. The chips were very insignificant and difficult to detect, but allowed remote access into the servers processing to then communicate with a more effective and powerful processor located in a different device.

4. How were investigators able to trace the chips back to the source?

They looked upstream at the supply chain in reverse, locating the different shipping companies, then manufacturers, and eventually the subcontractors that were enlisted to complete the servers.

## Things I want to know more about

How to identify tiny chips that don't belong; other areas of basic intrusion and component manipulation.
