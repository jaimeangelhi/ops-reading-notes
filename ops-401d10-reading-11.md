1. How would a security team benefit from implementing a SOAR solution?

After instituting a SOAR solution, automating previously tedious and time consuming mundane tasks would then free up the security team to perform more complex engineering and architecture, perform remediation activities, and identify further areas necessitating automation and development.  It basically allows them to work smarter, not harder, and focus on things that require more head-space than sifting through piles of data and monitoring.

2. Explain how a SOAR solution fits into the Incident Response process.

A SOAR solution fits into the Incident Response process as it allows analysts much more time to handle higher priorities and makes the incident response process run quickly and efficiently.  Basically, it can help to automate things that would previously require a team to eventually identify and resolve after an exponentially greater amount of time requirements.  A SOAR solution can effectively identify, isolate, log, and monitor a network threat before an analyst may even have time to recognize it's existence.
